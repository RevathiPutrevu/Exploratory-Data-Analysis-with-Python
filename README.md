### Business Context

The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. A food aggregator company **FoodHub** offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

The app allows the restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin of the delivery order from the restaurants.

### Objective

The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. 

As a Data Analyst, the task is to perform the data analysis to find answers to some important questions that will help the company to improve the business.

### Data Description

The dataset used for the analysis is a part of the [Data Analytics Essentials](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/data-analytics-essentials-online-course) certification course offered by the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin.

### Exploratory Data Analysis using Python

The dataset was analyzed to understand its structure, different data types, and statistical summary. Missing values were identified and treated using approriate methods. 

**Univariate Analysis**: Examined individual variables and their distributions

**Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**: Explored relationships between variables

**Data Visualization**: Used Python libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib to create clear and insightful visualizations

**Conclusion & Recommendations**: Provided recommendations to improve the company's business about the demand of different restaurants and cuisines, to help them enhance their customer experience and improve the business

All the project deliverables including the data set, data dictionary and analysis files (ipynb, html) have been uploaded under the Project files folder. 

**Note**: This project has been done as a Capstone project as a part of the online certification course offered by Texas McCombs School of Business in collaboration with Great Learning.
